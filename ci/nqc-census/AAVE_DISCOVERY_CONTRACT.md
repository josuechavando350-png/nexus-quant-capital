# RMC-006 — Authoritative Aave Reconciled Discovery

Status: certified only by an all-green exact-head run of
`nqc-census-aave-discovery.yml`. This document is the contract, not evidence.

Authorities:

- Census parent `8ebf6860e0a16964f5293df0ef40695b303b286d`.
- RMC-003.2 `519e5f6f7a4d42ff1cab67fef8306cfef9aab120`: log topics are ABI
  words that may be zero.

## Declared scope

Ethereum mainnet / Aave V3 / one D05-admitted deployment:

- Pool `0x87870bca3f3fd6335c3f4ce8392d69350b4fa4e2`;
- AddressesProvider `0x2f39d218133afab8f2b819b1066c7e434ad94e9e`;
- observation anchor 25,437,474
  (`0x0712ee92e6c2e2359c792e7aadc5bc35b9db392a2a5dc02f4575096437e8bfc8`).

This scope does not claim all Aave, all Aave V3, all Ethereum lending, or a
global market census.

## Surface A — exact-anchor getters (3 providers, byte-identical)

**Runtime code.** AddressesProvider, Pool proxy, Pool implementation (the
EIP-1967 slot) and price oracle runtime sha256 values must equal the
Protocol/Fork certified baseline. The PoolConfigurator proxy and its EIP-1967
implementation are recorded.

**Pool enumeration.**
- `getReserveAddressById(i)` is read for `i` in `0..getReservesCount()`.
- A zero slot is a dropped reserve, recorded in `dropped_reserve_ids`.
- `getReservesList()` must equal the non-empty slots in id order.
- `getReserveData` must return 15 words whose `id` equals the slot.

## Lineage — AddressesProvider history (2 providers, logs agreed exactly)

Scanned events: `ProxyCreated`, `AddressSet`, `AddressSetAsProxy`,
`PoolUpdated` and `PoolConfiguratorUpdated`. The scan runs from the
AddressesProvider's earliest-code block to the anchor.

**Pool lineage**
- Exactly one `ProxyCreated(POOL)`, at the Pool's earliest-code block.
- Any `AddressSet(POOL)` fails closed: it would be another deployment.
- The implementation chain (`PoolUpdated`, `AddressSetAsProxy(POOL)`) must be
  continuous. The first update may have a zero `old` only in the creating
  transaction. The chain must end at the exact-anchor EIP-1967
  implementation.

**PoolConfigurator lineage**
- Exactly one `ProxyCreated(POOL_CONFIGURATOR)`, at its earliest-code block.
- Every `AddressSet(POOL_CONFIGURATOR)` opens a new configurator window and
  must replace the current configurator.
- The last window must be the exact-anchor configurator.
- The implementation chain must be continuous and end at the exact-anchor
  EIP-1967 implementation.

Events for other ids are counted, not used. Indexed zero addresses (for
example the `old` of an initial update) are ordinary topics.

## Surface B — reserve lifecycle (2 providers, logs agreed exactly)

- `ReserveInitialized` and `ReserveDropped` are scanned from every historical
  configurator.
- An event is accepted only from the configurator whose window contains its
  coordinate `(block, transaction index, log index)`. An event from a
  replaced configurator fails closed.
- The lifecycle is replayed in canonical order with Aave V3
  `_addReserveToList` semantics:
  - an initialisation takes the first empty slot below the count, otherwise
    the next id;
  - a drop empties its slot;
  - an initialisation while active, or a drop while inactive, fails closed.

## Reconciliation

These are UNEXPLAINED deltas, and any one fails the node:

- `CURRENT_ONLY`
- `EVENT_ACTIVE_ONLY`
- `RESERVE_COUNT_MISMATCH` (simulated slots vs `getReservesCount`)
- `RESERVE_ID_SLOT_MISMATCH` (any slot)
- `TOKEN_IDENTITY_MISMATCH` (aToken, variable debt token)

Historical and dropped reserves are preserved in the reserve manifest. A
removal is EXPLAINED only by a canonical `ReserveDropped`; no reason is
inferred from absence.

## Evidence

- Every read is an RMC-003 typed observation in the RMC-004 store.
- Log scans are window checkpoints certified by `certify_range`.
- The history report lists every job manifest (`replay_manifests`).
- D05 admission is materialised from the observed code, configuration and
  oracle fingerprints, with every manifest as an evidence reference.

## Public RPC load

Live acquisition runs only from a `workflow_dispatch` on the exact branch
head, in the repository-wide concurrency group `nqc-census-public-rpc`
(`cancel-in-progress: false`). At most one live Census acquisition runs at a
time, and a running one is never cancelled. GitHub keeps one pending run per
group and a newer pending run replaces an older one. So a `pull_request` run
executes every gate except the live acquisition, in its own per-ref group,
and certifies nothing.
Log windows follow what each endpoint actually serves. mevblocker's window is
its documented 10,000 blocks: at 250,000 blocks it answered `-32603 service
temporarily unavailable` for about half of the windows (probe run
36588018889), and because the chain layer retries a whole batch when any item
is transient, D06 runs 36524919359 and 36526056098 exhausted their retry
budget. At 10,000 blocks, batched 100 per request, the same three filters
over the same range came back with zero failed items (probe run 36589205446).
A transient failure is retried and then resumed from committed RMC-004
checkpoints; it is never read as an empty range. Evidence, with an index of
every file's sha256, is uploaded even when the run fails, under a name
carrying the exact head, run id and attempt.

## Anchors

A run observes the declared anchor unless a dispatch names another block by
number and canonical hash, given together (`anchor_number`, `anchor_hash`).
The later anchor is for an incremental refresh (RMC-010).

The same checks apply at any anchor:
- Three providers must agree on the anchor header and the current surface.
- The history must run to that anchor.
- The history step refuses a current-surface report observed at another
  anchor.

At the declared anchor the measured reserve count (67) is required. At any
other anchor, the reserve count read from the three-provider current surface
must be reproduced exactly by the history reconciliation and the closeout.

A Pool implementation other than the Protocol/Fork certified one fails
closed at any anchor. The evidence artifact is named by anchor, exact head,
run and attempt.

## Crash/resume equivalence (offline, no network)

`nqc-rmc006-aave-resume-check` runs inside a network namespace with no
interfaces. It rebuilds a replay transport from the listed manifests only,
then:

1. Replays the whole reconstruction into a fresh store. The report must be
   byte-identical to the live report.
2. Repeats into fresh stores crashed after 1, ⅓, ½, ⅔ and all-but-one of the
   recorded requests. Each is resumed; the report and the RMC-004 evidence
   root must be identical to the clean replay. The five cases share nothing
   (each has its own store and transport) and run concurrently. Every one is
   checked and reported in cut order.

A tampered report, or a report missing a manifest, is rejected.

Public providers answer the same request with different bytes of the same
JSON value: key order, or a trailing newline. D06 run 36616344742 recorded
45 such requests, all on mevblocker, within one job and across jobs. A
transport keyed by request alone serves one byte form to every job, so that
run's replay could not reproduce the jobs that saw the other form. The
replay therefore:

- answers each request with its next recorded occurrence, in the order the
  reconstruction runs its jobs (bootstrap and anchor per provider, the three
  earliest-code searches, the lineage windows, the reserve windows);
- takes that order from the report, whose job lists must name exactly
  `replay_manifests`;
- fails when a request is made more often than it was recorded;
- after an interruption, first sets aside the occurrences of the jobs the
  store has committed, because the chain layer replays those from their own
  manifests, not through the transport.

The resume report counts the requests recorded with differing responses and,
for each interruption, the jobs already committed.

## Closeout

- Artifacts carry:
  - `schema_version`;
  - `generated_at`, set to the anchor block timestamp (RFC 3339, never the
    wall clock);
  - code commit and tree, declared universe id and D05 admission id;
  - chain domain, anchor, history range, lineage and source provenance.
- Each artifact's sha256 and RMC-004 artifact id are listed in
  `evidence-manifest.json`.
- The closeout is generated twice and must be byte-identical (`diff -r`).

PASS requires all of this on the exact head:

- zero provider mismatches;
- zero unexplained deltas;
- crash/resume equivalence;
- D05 admission;
- deterministic closeout;
- RMC-004 offline verification.

## Immutable-source offline recertification pilot

The restored canonical workflow accepts only the authenticated original D06
package named by `rmc006-recertification-source.json`. It has no live acquisition
path. Blank or altered dispatch identities fail; pull requests run code and
negative gates and certify nothing. The observation authority remains original
run 36820687233, artifact 11143129177 and block 26095351. The older live CLI
default is never used in recertification.

The current replay uses verified bootstrap and intact committed point checkpoints
with an empty replay transport and no fallback. History retains its original
occurrence-ordered replay and five independent crash cuts. Both execute inside a
new disconnected network namespace; the authenticated source is bind-mounted
read-only. Admission and two byte-identical closeouts use a separate working store.
The source and output stores must pass independent Rust and Python verification.

New closeout producer identity is the actual verification checkout commit/tree.
Original observations, source member commitments and acquisition identity remain
unchanged and accompany the new evidence. Anchor-derived `generated_at` remains
the historical observation time, not the time of verification. Local replay is
not canonical certification. Only a successful exact-head canonical workflow
and its final immutable artifact provide new verification authority. D14 remains
blocked; this pilot does not grant admission to other stages or alter ancestry.

`offline-verification.json` records `verification_started_at` and
`verification_completed_at` from the new run's actual UTC system clock. It
explicitly separates those times from `original_observation_at`, which remains
the source anchor block timestamp. The existing evidence index binds this whole
report through its SHA-256 and size; its schema is unchanged. Canonical run ID,
attempt, success and authoritative run timing must additionally be authenticated
from GitHub Actions metadata after completion. Original observation reports are
never redated, and a new verification time never implies a new acquisition.
