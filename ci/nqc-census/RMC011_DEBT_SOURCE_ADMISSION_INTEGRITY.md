# RMC-011 — Debt-family real-source promotion integrity

This is **a terminal-admission correctness repair, not a D11 capital certification**. The original two debt families (`COLLATERALIZED_BORROWING`, `PERSISTENT_DEBT`) remain unresolved in the unchanged source-universe lock. There are still zero NQC-approved external gas providers.

## Original defect

In `verify-rmc011-debt-family-promotion.py`, when both debt rows had status `AUTHENTICATED_REAL_SOURCE`, the code returned `AUTHENTICATED_REAL_SOURCE_PATH` without checking `terminally_resolved`, the canonical implementation path or even a `resolution_evidence` object. A minimal forged pair of status strings could therefore obtain a positive helper-level promotion result. The upstream universal gate was stricter, but this reusable helper was fail-open if called independently.

## Correction

- Validate schema 2, unique family identities, the D11 non-closeout flag, and atomicity of the two debt-family outcomes.
- For the real-source route, demand `terminally_resolved=true`, exact canonical implementation path, correct per-family `AUTHENTICATED_REAL_SOURCE` evidence kind, producing workflow and repository, positive integer run/artifact IDs, SHA-1 head identity, nonzero SHA-256 ZIP and member hashes, exact per-family member path, unique file hashes, and common GitHub run/artifact transport for both families.
- Hard-reject all-zero hashes in the preexisting rejection route too.
- A successful *syntactic* wiring report is called `AUTHENTICATED_REAL_SOURCE_REFERENCES_DECLARED` and explicitly says `independent_artifact_authentication_complete=false` and `d11_terminal_closed=false`. Only the separate production workflow can authenticate actual GitHub Actions bytes and source provenance.
- Preserve the existing status of all 13 families in the canonical source-universe; this patch only rejects false promotion.

## Adversarial coverage

The original six tests plus 21 new tests cover missing witnesses, bare statuses, boolean IDs, wrong repository/workflow, missing canonical path, mismatched terminal flags, corrupted/duplicated/zero hashes, mismatched artifact transports, mixed outcomes, duplicate family identities, source schema, and attempts to self-close D11. Synthetic test witnesses **are not real capital**.

## Reproduction

From the exact feature head, run:

    python3 ci/nqc-census/test_verify_rmc011_debt_family_promotion.py -v
    python3 ci/nqc-census/verify-rmc011-debt-family-promotion.py
    python3 ci/nqc-census/verify-rmc011-capital-source-universe.py

The specialized GitHub Actions workflow also checks the pinned Git blob identity of the unchanged canonical RMC-011 capital universe, provider registry, and final-Census authority lock. It must remain **blocked**: 13 unresolved families, 0 authorized external providers, and no terminal Census closeout. No RPC requests, accounts, payments, wallet signing, or live trades.

## Separate seven-family evidence transport defect

A previously successful original source run, [Actions 37670688821](https://github.com/josuechavando350-png/nexus-engine/actions/runs/37670688821), published archive **11505471187** (ZIP SHA-256 `a8f289f5c6139c84051f1430e0df8a84ee48aaee42f44a049ac433647971db47`). Its recorded GitHub producing head is `284273331a0db6332af534e7d1184827708d23ba`, but its artifact name contains `5eec64fb169cf99b649ba727a8ebc603bd950c8a`, GitHub's PR merge commit. The source-family promotion gate requires that the artifact name contain **the exact producing source head**. Therefore the previously green run is insufficient for promotion without correcting the archive identity.

The bounded-family evidence workflow now uses `github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha` consistently for checkout, internal evidence head and artifact name, on both PR and push runs. Tests reject mock evidence named with the wrong SHA and check the workflow's exact interpolation. The workflow reruns its original seven-family exhaustive-rejection tests, and additionally runs the source-family promotion regressions.

The new producer correction does **not** authorize retroactively renaming original immutable archives or pinning any RMC-011 family. First produce new archive bytes and reauthenticate the exact successful workflow run, artifact digest and per-family member hashes independently. Old mismatched artifacts stay mismatched; evidence must not be manufactured.

## Outstanding material blockers

Authenticated 13-family capital discovery/resolution and *actual* nonrecourse native-gas underwriting are still required before D11 can close. D12 full actionability, D13 executable economics, D14 eight genuine stage pins, D15 temporal completeness, D16 conservative economics and D17 independent final adjudication remain separate. A negative terminal Census is allowed only when scope completeness and source authorities actually support it.
