# RMC-016: Historical pre-block WETH gas-reference valuation (NOT economic closeout)

This read-only source-linked diagnostic tests a first **five-block slice** of the 123 distinct Ethereum blocks containing 127 historical Aave V3 winner transactions. It independently queries **dRPC** and **BlastAPI** for the WETH price exposed by the Aave V3 Ethereum oracle at the **previous block end** and **winning block end**, and confirms exact price/header parity. The 127 receipt rows and 139 LiquidationCall records are separately authenticated; each transaction's receipt gas is charged once per tx hash.

## Exact upstream artifacts

- Blockscout raw historical event universe: successful run 37718661409, artifact 11524139188, SHA256 6b4098c1acf153106ac5b67d2c5c7db5cd0295a16c782ad8c34ae75303306204.
- dRPC canonical receipt stage (source workflow failed overall for its BlastAPI phase): run 37719091371, artifact 11524199698, SHA256 182b5e81b00ca04e53c9193c1496a725dc152ade9a17d3ab2dfaeb5045ac86b6. The complete 127-row dRPC stage must be reauthenticated; **the failed workflow is not a terminal source authority**.
- Independently observed WETH historical oracle sample: successful run 37719715290, artifact 11524894285, SHA256 5d321ec4707da6b9b0a0e1b24ce2d28992bb9329dd937baa6466c759359c3f73. Includes block 25883782 with WETH oracle price 243398000000 in USD-1e8 units and block hash ec6d981a... .
- Pin oracle address 0x54586be62e3c3580375ae3723c145253060ca0c2; WETH 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2; function selector 0xb3596f07; base unit 100000000.

## Arithmetic and claim boundary

An observed transaction consumes wei of native ETH in its actual competitor receipt. For a prior-end-block price P denominated USD*1e8 and gas paid G in wei, **reference USD-WAD** is floor(G*P/1e8). Two providers must agree exactly on each pair of block hashes and price values. Price at block B-1 is data known before B; price at B's end may contain effects after the transaction. Neither observation alone reconstructs *intra-block transaction prestate*. If they differ, the report flags an oracle transition; even when equal the report keeps prestate certainty FALSE.

This diagnostic is a preblock **reference valuation** only. It does NOT establish an exact transaction-time gas USD cost, profit of original liquidators, any swap or flash loan cost, actual asset monetization, independent full-month event-source coverage, externally financed gas or principal for Nexus, Nexus inclusion or competition-adjusted capture probability, realized Nexus P&L, the USD 300K/month target or RMC017 closure. No live trades, no signing and no user capital. Every terminal money/census claim remains false.

Production CI authenticates all three immutable run/head/tree/artifact-name/digest pairs before using these source bytes. A partially completed or failed RPC run preserves a diagnostic report and never produces a false PASS. Each later batch requires an explicitly pinned prior source and disjoint winner-block window; avoid look-ahead using the D08 terminal snapshot to price earlier trades.

## Planned next gates

Continue through all 123 unique observed winning blocks under independently corroborated, rate-safe acquisition, then historical oracle pricing of the 23 unique underlying assets (13 appearing as debt and 18 as collateral, with overlapping roles) from the certified 139 event legs, historical decimals/configuration, flash premiums, route costs and Nexus ex-ante feasibility. All observations must remain partitioned by transaction with integer arithmetic and no assumed capture.
